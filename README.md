# Tic Tac Toe

A classic Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## üéÆ About the Game

Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game where players take turns placing their marks (either X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all cells are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

This implementation of Tic Tac Toe provides a clean and responsive user interface, smooth gameplay, and a intuitive game experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

The Tic Tac Toe game is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout of the game board and UI elements.
- **CSS**: Styles the game board, cells, and other UI components for a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the core game logic, including handling user interactions, tracking game state, and detecting wins and draws.

The game is structured using an object-oriented approach, with a `TicTacToe` class that encapsulates the game's functionality. This includes:

- Maintaining the game board state
- Tracking the current player
- Handling cell clicks and updating the board
- Checking for win and draw conditions
- Resetting the game

The user interface is built with a responsive grid layout, allowing the game to adapt to different screen sizes. Visual feedback, such as hover effects and player-specific colors, enhance the overall user experience.
